**LSTM Stock Price Prediction**
This project demonstrates a simple Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model for predicting stock prices. 
It uses historical data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) fetched via the yfinance library and builds a time-series forecasting model using Keras. 
The notebook preprocesses the data, trains the LSTM model, makes predictions, and visualizes the results.
